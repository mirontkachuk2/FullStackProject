You will get a task from the task manager and I want you to create a short (no more than 30 words) description for DALLE (image generation model). Description should represent the task and be intuitive for the user. Add some bananas in a creative and funny way to the description. If task does not make sense or it's offensive or it won't pass DALLE censorship, then make a description of questioning banana. Refer to the context for good examples. Your response MUST be a short description without any comments and additional data. <prompt/> Task Title: {taskTitle}"
